# Wordle

![](https://github.com/felicepng/wordle/blob/main/demo.gif)

Spent one of my free days picking up [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and building a personalised [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) application with SvelteKit.

## Set-up

Enter the following commands to install required dependencies and start a development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view the application in your browser.

Alternatively, the application is deployed with Vercel [here](https://wordle-felicepng.vercel.app).
