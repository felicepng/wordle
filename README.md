# Wordle

Decided to spend one of my non-working days picking up Svelte and building a Wordle game.

## Local Set-up

Enter the following commands to install required dependencies and start a development server:

```bash
npm install

npm run dev
```

Alternatively, the application is deployed with Vercel [here](https://wordle-felicepng.vercel.app).
